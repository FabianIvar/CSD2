> Public and Private
 All the class members declared under public will be available to everyone. The data members and member functions declared public can be accessed by other classes too. The public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program using the direct member access operator (.)

> Environment variables
 Environment variables are globally accessible named values that store information about the system environment where your code is executed. They are also used to store configuration settings, paths to important directories, and other system-specific data as well. In this article, we will learn how to get environment variables in C++.

> Constructor delegation
 Constructor delegation kan gebruikt worden voor constructor overloading wanneer de tweede constructor dezelfde code heeft als de eerste maar nu met meer dingen erbij.
 Het kan ook wanneer je een derived class hebt en daar code aan wilt toevoegen uit de superclass. dit heet constructor delegation in inheritance.

> Destructor
 A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed automatically whenever an object of its class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

 Dus een functie in een class die uitgevoerd wordt wanneer het object 'out of scope' gaat of wanneer het object wordt verwijdert met 'delete'

 Een tilde ~ betekent dat iets een destructor is.

 Eigenschappen van een destructor:

  - Destructors are automatically called when an object goes out of scope.
  - Destructor has the same name as the class and is denoted using tilde(~) sign.
  - It is automatically created when a class is created.
  - Destructors do not have any return type and do not accept any parameters/arguments.
  - You can't define more than one destructor.
  - Destructors cannot be inherited.
  - Destructors cannot be overloaded.

> Scope resolution indicator '::'
 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_scope_resolution_operator.htm

> Namespace

 A namespace is used to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables, etc., with the same name available in different libraries. To access members which are defined inside a namespace, we use the scope resolution operator '::'.

> Conditional processing blocks aka Macros

 #ifdef identifier is essentially equivalent to #if defined identifier.

 #ifndef identifier is essentially equivalent to #if !defined identifier.

 #elifdef identifier is essentially equivalent to #elif defined identifier.

 #elifndef identifier is essentially equivalent to #elif !defined identifier. (since C++23)

> Type-inference (auto)
 Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/type-inference-in-c-auto-and-decltype/
 auto is a non-specific type, if it is a float array, auto will turn into a float, if it's an int auto will turn into an int etc.

> Struct
 Link: https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_structs.asp
 struct is just a class without public and private

> Templates
 Templates let you write a function or class that works with different
 data types, kinda cool. Might be useful with input validation?
 it is convention to use T as a placeholder for a data type.

> constexpr
 constexpr is a feature added in C++ 11.
 The main idea is a performance improvement of programs by doing
 computations at compile time rather than run time.

> template metaprogramming
 Vgm is de basis een beetje dat je de compiler allemaal dingen laat uitrekenen
 zodat het geen recourses meer kost tijdens run-time! cool

 Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/template-metaprogramming-in-c/

> constexpr
 constexpr specifies that the value of an object or function
 can be evaluated at compile-time and the expression can be used
 in other constant expressions.

 again typecasting but cool because it converts pointer

> Convert/cast string to char array
 A constant char array is good enough for you so you go with,
  const char *array = tmp.c_str();
 Or you need to modify the char array so constant is not ok,
 then just go with this
  char *array = &tmp[0];

 Both of them are just assignment operations and most of the time that is just what you need, if you really need a new copy then follow other fellows answers.

> .h vs .hpp file extention
 Both work for c++, hpp doesn't work in c coding language.
 People writing code for c++ inside .h files can be ambiguous because it's not
 clear if the code inside the header is meant for c++ or c.
